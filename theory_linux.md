What is od?
🔧 od = Octal Dump

It’s an ancient Unix tool whose name comes from when people looked at binary data in octal (base 8) instead of hexadecimal (base 16).

But nowadays, od can output binary data in many formats:

    Octal (-o)

    Hex (-x)

    Decimal (-d)

    Characters (-c)

    Integers (-i)

🏷️ -An

This means:

    "Don't print addresses or labels on the side — just give me the numbers."

Normally, od would show something like:

0000000 51342

The left column (0000000) is the byte address in the input stream (e.g., where in the file this came from). It's useful for debugging memory or file offsets — but we don't care here.

Using -An, it becomes:

51342

Just the value. Clean. Simple. ✅

Fantastic question again! Let’s break it down clearly and gently.
🧠 What is $1 in awk?

In AWK, when you give it input text, it automatically splits each line into fields (like columns).

By default, it splits on spaces or tabs.

Then it gives you:

    $1 → the first word/field

    $2 → the second field

    $3 → the third field

    etc.

📦 So When Is $1 Created?

It’s created as soon as AWK reads a line of input.

Example input to AWK:

45382

Since it’s just one number, that whole line becomes:

    $1 = 45382

If the line was:

45382 some other text

Then:

    $1 = 45382

    $2 = some

    $3 = other

    $4 = text

AWK splits each line like this automatically — you don’t need to do anything special.
💡 Where Does the Input Come From?

From the command before the pipe (|):

od -An -N2 -i /dev/urandom | tr -d ' ' | awk -v max=5 '{ print $1 % max }'

This is what happens:

    od gives a random number like: 39429

    tr -d ' ' removes the space → 39429

    That string is piped into AWK

Now inside AWK:

    It sees: 39429

    Automatically splits it into fields

    Sets $1 = 39429
